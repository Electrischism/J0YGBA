gbajs3 -- A Browser Based Game Boy Advance Emulator
======

This project is a Game Boy Advance emulator that is freely licensed and works in any modern browser without plugins.

It began as a re-skin of the [gbajs2](https://github.com/andychase/gbajs2) fork by andychase, but now supports both the [mGBA wasm](https://github.com/thenick775/mgba/tree/feature/wasm) core as well as gbajs, a pure javascript GBA core.

This project was driven specifically by my need to play modern GBA rom hacks outside of desktop applications, without side loading or building through xcode.

Use it online! <https://gba.nicholas-vancise.dev>

## Docker
* Requires an env file of the format:
```
ROM_PATH=./<local-server-rom-path>/
SAVE_PATH=./<local-server-save-path>/
CLIENT_HOST=https://<your-client-location>
CERT_LOC=./<path to your certificate>
KEY_LOC=./<path to your key>
```
* Run `cp .env.example .env` for local builds, then adjust values or add certs/required directories
* Testing certificates can be created with:
```
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt
```
* Golang api expects a sqlite file within the ./docker/server/auth directory consisting of username/password pairs generated with bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword, as well as two uuid fields for token id's
```
type User struct {
  Username  string
  PassHash  []byte
  TokenSlug uuid.UUID
  TokenID   uuid.UUID
}
```
* There is a helper script in ./docker/helper/users_db_helper.go that can be used to generate your initial database file. This will output a file of the name users.db.
```
go run users_db_helper.go
```
* Simply run `docker-compose up --build` and your services will build and start
* Golang api swagger UI can be found at `/api/documentation/`
